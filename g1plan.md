## Half 1 Rotation

| Time | Lineup | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **20:00-12:00** (8 min) | Declan / KJ / Jason / Zach / Mingma | **Balanced.** Elite rebounding (Zach+Mingma). Two playmakers. Jason locks down. Run half-court sets through Declan or Mingma post touches. |
| **12:00-8:00** (4 min) | Josh / Lance / Jason / Zach / Logan | **Transition + shooting.** Push pace with Josh's speed. Logan spaces the floor. Defensive pressure from Lance+Jason. Less half-court creation - keep it simple. |
| **8:00-4:00** (4 min) | Josh / Lance / Declan / Zach / Isaac | **Controlled + size.** Declan runs offense. Zach + Isaac for boards and size. Quick guards attack off dribble. Most balanced bench unit. |
| **4:00-0:00** (4 min) | KJ / Mingma / Jason / Josh / Lance | **Clutch + shooting.** Top intangibles (Jason, Mingma's Clutch Gene). KJ adds shooting and size. Elite perimeter D. Box out hard - Mingma is the primary rebounder. |
